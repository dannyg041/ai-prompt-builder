# AI Prompt Builder

## Overview
AI Prompt Builder is a web application that helps users create clear, structured prompts for large language models. It guides users through key prompt components such as role, goal, audience, tone, and constraints to improve AI output quality.

## Problem
Many people struggle to get useful results from AI tools because their prompts are vague, incomplete, or poorly structured.

## Solution
This app provides a lightweight interface that helps users think through the essential elements of a good prompt and generates a reusable, copy-ready prompt instantly.

## Features
- Role-based prompt framing
- Goal and audience definition
- Tone and output selection
- Constraint specification
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Prompt templates by use case (marketing, coding, teaching, writing, analysis)
- Save and load prompts using localStorage
- Dark mode with system preference detection
- Clean, minimal UI
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility support (ARIA labels, focus states, reduced motion)

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS (with CSS custom properties for theming)
- JavaScript (vanilla, no frameworks)

## How It Works
1. Optionally select a template to pre-fill the form
2. Fill out the prompt fields (AI Role and Goal are required)
3. Click "Generate Prompt" to build a structured prompt
4. Copy the generated prompt or save it for later use
5. Toggle dark mode with the button in the header

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate core front-end skills
- Show product thinking and UX clarity
- Build a complete, deployable project without frameworks
